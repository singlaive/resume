####Summary:
Experienced software engineer.  


####Career history:  
* Software engineer, Cisco June 2013 ~ Pres.  
Design, develop and integrate embedded solution for consumer digital TV set top box across range of projects. Experiences cover different roles as software developer, system integrator and QA.  

System Integrator, since 2017.
Diagnose, investigate and integrate issues and features for the next generation digital TV broadcasting system at client side for SKY Europe. Fast and well targeted analysis is performed in end to end scale on full stack from applications down to Linux kernels and drivers through over 50 software components across three countries (UK, Germany and Italy). Solve top issues in minutes typically, if not hours or days, in this E2E system mainly written by embedded C and C++, maintained by Shell script, Perl and Python, tested by C/C++ and Python.  
Full stack feature developer, since 2015. 
Design, develop and test implementation of requirements in agile manner at full stack level on set-top-box deployed to SKY Germany foundation project. The implementation leaded or involved was for features which can be limited to one or several components in middleware, the binding or application like EPG (Electronic Programme Guide), or vertically across all layers. Hands on features like STB bring up, software download, service scanning in cable broadcasting, http enhancement, etc. Worked in a scrum team and occasionally scrum master role was taken to facilitate the team.The full stack system is mainly written by embedded C and action script, maintained by Shell script, tested by Python and action script.Component developer, Since 2013Developed solutions per middleware component in waterfall model for various projects, BSKYB, UPC, SKY New Zealand, Canal Digital and so on. Leaded the implementation in components for metadata retrieving for programs and services. The middleware is mainly written by embedded C, maintained by Shell script, tested by C.  
Software engineer, NDS Limited Jan 2010 ~ May 2013. 
Wrote embedded software for set top boxes and PVRs.  
#####Interesting challenges:• Leaded the process of static analysis in SKY Deutschland foundation project since May 2016. Coach and maintain Coverity as system admin.• Coach of Agile methodology TDD & BDD.• Author of various personal innovation projects: Static analysis tool for actionscript and C binding layer, Automatic set top box flashing system, Agilitymeasurement algorithm for agile team, etc.• Leaded a team the miner and won champion of 24hour codeathon (HackIT V2015 CISCO) in Chandler’s Ford. An innovation method of trajectory sharing. 

####Education
PhD, Department of Electronic & Electrical Engineering. 
University of Bath, Bath, UK, awarded in Dec 2009. 
An optimised mathematical model was built for designing high performance integrated electronic device, known as FISOS, Functional Integrated Semiconductor Opitcal Source. The paper also demonstrated how the design can be integrated in multiple applications, like filters and spectrum analysers.
