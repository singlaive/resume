    {
      \begin{cvitems}
        \item {Implemented broad range of features, from ones requiring driver communications, for example front panel LED control; to interactive UI improvements (EPG and iApps), for example rendering HDCP and HDR/10bit color depth information on screen; or vertically across middleware to providing comprehensive API to EPG, for example enhanced http API.}
        \item {Coached the team with Test Driven Development approach applied to most features involved which came with stronger code secured by well structured tests with significantly improved code coverage.}
        \item{Led setting up criteria and process of static analysis for C/C++ codes across the whole Sky Deutschland code base. In charge of deploying Coverity client to associated infrastructures. Built pipelines integrating static analysis scan through the project and deployed them on Jenkins. Supported the 60 heads team as Coverity coach since 2016. Over 300 high impacted security related defects were exposed with Coverity scan and the number was reduced to lower than 100 with follow-on actions. There were no new Coverity error introduced into the release since then thanks to the effective process and CI pipelines.}
