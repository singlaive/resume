    {Voice control over set-top box}
    {2017}
    {There was no voice control on BskyB's Q boxes. Its fancy bluetooth remote supports voice search though.}
    {
      \begin{cvitems}
        \item {Built up a two men aiming to integrate voice control into set-top box powered by CMUSphinx library.}
        \item {Set up a CI system in docker and built pipelines to build, unit test, system test and deploy to two Raspberry PIs.}
        \item{Techniques: C++, Bash, CMake, Concourse CI, Debian, CPPUnit, GIT, Docker, Kanban, TDD}
      \end{cvitems}
    }
  \cventryX
    {Continuous deployment integraqted pipeline}
    {2016}
    {Existing CI pipelines in CISCO lacked the step deploying binaries to engineers' set-top boxes for feature acceptance testing or regression testing. Full stack builds of particular version were flashed manually, which was tedious and easily mistaken.}
    {
      \begin{cvitems}
        \item {Built Python backend on Raspberry PI with REST API, which polls software releases and flashes into set-top boxes.}
        \item {Deployed to two teams helping hassle free testing, and powered up a 8 set-top box rack for automatic testing.}
        \item{Techniques: Python, Flask, Fabric, Javascript, jQuery, BootStrap, REST, Debian}
      \end{cvitems}
    }
  \cventryX
    {Static analysis tool}
    {2015}
    {There was no unit testing for binding layer between ActionScript API and C implementations in SKY Deutschland project.}
    {
      \begin{cvitems}
        \item {Implemented utility to do static analysis with predefined rules, which validate the mapping of API declarations and implementations, function signatures, and naming convention consistency.}
        \item {Over ten defects were exposed and fixed, none were found afterwards with this tool deployed to CI.}
        \item {Techniques: Python, Regular Expression, JSON}
      \end{cvitems}
    }
